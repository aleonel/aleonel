### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, GitHub community, I just learned to create my secret README for my profile. 

I am excited to connect with all of you and share my latest projects and experiences. If you're interested in what I do and eager to explore my abilities, I encourage you to visit my website. It serves as a glimpse into my world of continuous learning and a platform where I strive to apply new technologies in creative ways.

My commitment to excellence goes beyond personal growthâ€”I deeply value the code I develop and its impact on user experience. That's why I prioritize user testing in all of my projects. By engaging real users to interact with and provide feedback on my solutions, I ensure that the end result is intuitive, user-friendly, and aligned with their needs.

Efficiency is a core principle in everything I undertake. I not only focus on writing adaptable and user-friendly code but also invest in comprehensive commenting. This promotes seamless collaboration and guarantees that the code remains accessible and comprehensible for future contributors.

As I continue to expand my professional horizons, I am open to new learning opportunities and collaborations.

Hobbies:

One of my biggest hobbies is exploring the captivating world of the stock market. I find great joy in being able to participate in companies and speculate about their success. It amazes me how the stock market reflects the intricate dynamics of the economy, where both micro-level company performance and macro-level factors shape its movements. The market serves as a barometer for the collective sentiments, hopes, and fears of investors worldwide. It is truly fascinating to witness how various events, such as economic indicators, geopolitical developments, and technological advancements, can have a profound impact on stock prices and market trends. This deep interest in the stock market has inspired me to combine my passion for finance with my technical skills, leading me to develop my SaaS application that incorporates sentiment analysis to better understand the ever-changing landscape of stock news.

Current Project:

I am currently working on an exciting project that aligns with my interests and the assignment requirements. My focus is on developing my first Software as a Service (SaaS) application. The aim of this project is to leverage the power of ChatGPT, a powerful language model, for sentiment analysis on stock news headlines.

Considering my busy schedule due to work and study commitments, I often struggle to keep up with the latest stock news when it is released. To address this, I have devised a solution using ChatGPT to summarize headlines for me and perform sentiment analysis on each news article as it is published. While the API is still in development, I have already sketched out the frontend of the application, which can be accessed at https://bullishornot.com.

To collect the necessary data, I am utilizing Python's requests library to scrape Yahoo's news page. This allows me to retrieve the headlines and links related to a specific stock on any given day. Once I have the link, I extract the text content of the article. Subsequently, I pass this text content to ChatGPT's official API using various prompts to obtain different results. For instance, I can generate a bullishness score ranging from 0 to 10 based on sentiment analysis performed by the Davinci003 model. Additionally, I obtain a concise description of the findings based on previous prompts and ChatGPT's generated responses.

While the project is still in its beta phase, I am actively working on improving its functionality and performance. As the website version is not fully operational yet, I am currently exploring hosting options to run Python files effectively. Moreover, I am also recreating the same script in PHP to evaluate its viability. It's worth mentioning that this project is a work in progress, and I am dedicating time to refine and enhance it.

Professional (fulltime work) Webdeveloper:

As a dedicated web developer at Artistic Pavers (current employer), I have had the opportunity to work on several exciting projects that have showcased my competencies and creativity. One of my most significant accomplishments is the development of APM-PRO (Artistic Pavers Professional Portal), a progressive web application (PWA) that serves as a comprehensive platform for online ordering, estimation, calculators, and user management. I take immense pride in being the sole developer and designer of this cutting-edge customer portal, utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python for seamless functionality, as well as handling email integration.

A standout feature of APM-PRO is the Conversion Tools, which include an advanced calculator enabling professionals to obtain precise product quantities and waste factors, optimizing resource utilization. I also implemented the Take Off program, an automated calculation tool for pool deck sections that considers industry-specific waste factors, resulting in accurate measurements and reduced errors. Additionally, the Online Order & Estimates functionality allows professionals to browse products, select colors and sizes, and conveniently place orders.

Another project that I spearheaded is APM EasyCalc, an innovative tool that revolutionized the estimation process for pool installations. By developing a custom solution to replace outdated methods, such as generic percentage-based calculations, I successfully improved accuracy and tailored the tool to meet the unique needs of our customers. The positive response and increased order volume witnessed through the EasyCalc estimator have been truly rewarding, as it streamlined the purchasing experience and enhanced customer satisfaction.

In addition to these achievements, I undertook the complete transformation of the Artistic Pavers website, turning it from an outdated version into a modern and user-friendly platform. From front-end design using HTML and CSS to back-end functionality implemented with PHP and Python for email integration, I meticulously handled every aspect of the website development. Notably, I developed a custom Progressive Web App (PWA) with interactive calculators, a professional portal for customers, and a smart gallery with advanced search functionality. The implementation of an online ordering system further improved the user experience and eliminated manual intervention, making it convenient for customers while reducing administrative overhead.

During my tenure, I also successfully introduced an online fillable form system, replacing traditional order placement methods with a dynamic and efficient solution. This development significantly improved user engagement and website traffic, allowing customers to easily select products, quantities, and submit orders with a single click. The streamlined process facilitated prompt order processing and response from our sales and estimate departments, resulting in increased customer satisfaction and order volume.

Even beyond my work at Artistic Pavers, I demonstrated my technical prowess and entrepreneurial spirit through the creation of a groundbreaking AI-based search engine called Homework King during my college years. This platform aimed to provide students with highly accurate answers to their questions. While the project gained substantial attention and popularity, I made the difficult decision to halt its development due to potential copyright concerns.

Through my various projects and endeavors, I have consistently demonstrated my ability to deliver top-notch web development solutions, from conception to execution. I take great pride in my accomplishments and the positive impact they have had on both the company and its customers. If you would like to learn more about these projects or discuss potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out. I am always enthusiastic about sharing insights and exploring new development opportunities.
