### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, GitHub community, I just learned to create my secret README for my profile. 

I am excited to connect with all of you and share my latest projects and experiences. If you're interested in what I do and eager to explore my abilities, I encourage you to visit my website. It serves as a glimpse into my world of continuous learning and a platform where I strive to apply new technologies in creative ways.

My commitment to excellence goes beyond personal growthâ€”I deeply value the code I develop and its impact on user experience. That's why I prioritize user testing in all of my projects. By engaging real users to interact with and provide feedback on my solutions, I ensure that the end result is intuitive, user-friendly, and aligned with their needs.

Efficiency is a core principle in everything I undertake. I not only focus on writing adaptable and user-friendly code but also invest in comprehensive commenting. This promotes seamless collaboration and guarantees that the code remains accessible and comprehensible for future contributors.

As I continue to expand my professional horizons, I am open to new learning opportunities and collaborations.

I am currently working on an exciting project that aligns with my interests and the assignment requirements. My focus is on developing my first Software as a Service (SaaS) application. The aim of this project is to leverage the power of ChatGPT, a powerful language model, for sentiment analysis on stock news headlines.

Considering my busy schedule due to work and study commitments, I often struggle to keep up with the latest stock news when it is released. To address this, I have devised a solution using ChatGPT to summarize headlines for me and perform sentiment analysis on each news article as it is published. While the API is still in development, I have already sketched out the frontend of the application, which can be accessed at https://bullishornot.com.

To collect the necessary data, I am utilizing Python's requests library to scrape Yahoo's news page. This allows me to retrieve the headlines and links related to a specific stock on any given day. Once I have the link, I extract the text content of the article. Subsequently, I pass this text content to ChatGPT's official API using various prompts to obtain different results. For instance, I can generate a bullishness score ranging from 0 to 10 based on sentiment analysis performed by the Davinci003 model. Additionally, I obtain a concise description of the findings based on previous prompts and ChatGPT's generated responses.

While the project is still in its beta phase, I am actively working on improving its functionality and performance. As the website version is not fully operational yet, I am currently exploring hosting options to run Python files effectively. Moreover, I am also recreating the same script in PHP to evaluate its viability. It's worth mentioning that this project is a work in progress, and I am dedicating time to refine and enhance it.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my profile and projects. Let's connect, exchange ideas, and explore potential avenues for collaboration. Together, we can achieve something extraordinary!
